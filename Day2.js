// variable: its a container to store value.

//function: a block of code its will executed when it is called.

   // Datatypes

   // There are two data types primitive and non- primitive.

   // Boolean - (True /False), Strings - (Words, sentence, mix of numbers and words(ex - address)),
   // Number - (integer and decimal values), 2 ,4, 101, 23.50, 34.99 
    // What are Strings - Anything which is present inside the double quotes or the single quotes are called as strings 
    // Numbers - includes Integer and decimal values (2/3/34.66/99.99) 
    // Variables - They are used to store the values which could be of any type i.e. Number type or String Type or Boolean type. 
    // rules for assigning names to variables 
    // try to make the variables name declarative 
    // it uses Camel Case 
    // Variable names are case sensitive 
    // fName, fname, Fname, fnAme, fnaMe,
     // Keywords are of three types 
     // let, var, const 
     // -----declaraing / initializing/ redeclaring---- 




   // let - These keywords are used to assign variables with values 
   // 1 . They can be declared in a line and then initialized with a value in anaother lines. 
   // 2. They can be also declared and initialized in the same line 
   // 3 . They cannot be redeclared.....But can be reinitialized.... 
   // 4. ******We cannot have Two Variables with same name in Let*******

   // 1 . They can be declared in a line and then initialized with a value in another lines. 
   // 2. They can be also declared and initialized in the same line 
   // 3. They can be redeclared.....and also can be reinitialized.... 
   // 4. ******We can have Two or more Variables with same name in Var*******

  // 1. They can be declared and initialized in the same line only. 
  // 2 . They cannot be redeclared.....
